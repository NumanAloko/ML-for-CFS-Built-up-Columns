# ML-for-CFS-Built-up-Columns
This repository provides machine learing (ML) models for predicting axial strength and classifying buckling failure modes of cold-formed steel (CFS) built-up columns. It includes regression and classification models trained on 1037 experimental results, offering a data-driven approach to  design CFS built-up columns under axial loading.
