# ML-for-CFS-Built-up-Columns
This repository provides machine learning (ML) models for predicting axial strength and classifying buckling failure modes of cold-formed steel (CFS) built-up columns. It includes regression and classification models trained on 1037 experimental results, offering a data-driven approach to design CFS built-up columns under axial loading.

For comprehensive details about developing machine learning models, please refer to the open-access journal article titled "Capacity Prediction and Failure Mode Classification of Cold-Formed Steel Built-up Columns Using Machine Learning Methods," https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tws.2024.112873.

The complete and detailed database of Cold-formed steel built-up columns (CFS_Database. V2) is available at the University of Bristol data repository, data.bris, at https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.1sizgyhjuufm926zq4o5ff5b48.
