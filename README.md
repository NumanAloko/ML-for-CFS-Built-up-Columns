# ML-for-CFS-Built-up-Columns
This repository provides machine learning (ML) models for predicting axial strength and classifying buckling failure modes of cold-formed steel (CFS) built-up columns. It includes regression and classification models trained on 1037 experimental results, offering a data-driven approach to design CFS built-up columns under axial loading.
For comprehensive details about developing machine learning models, please refer to the open-access journal article titled "Capacity Prediction and Failure Mode Classification of Cold-Formed Steel Built-up Columns Using Machine Learning Methods," https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tws.2024.112873.
To access the complete and detailed database of Cold-formed steel built-up columns, please visit the University of Bristol's repository using the following link: ##### will be added upon receiving ###, where you can find all relevant data details, a user manual, and buckling analysis data of all CFS built-up sections.
